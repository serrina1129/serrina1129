<h1>Hi, my name is Serrina Brown <br/><a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/serrina-brown/">Cybersecurity Professional</a> </h1>

<h2>About Me:</h2>
<b>Hello, my name is Serrina Brown. I am a Computer Science graduate from Queens College with a growing passion for Identity & Access Management (IAM) and cybersecurity. I hold CompTIA Security+, A+, and Data+ certifications, and I’ve gained hands-on experience with Active Directory, Azure Entra ID, and core IAM workflows through lab work and my internship as a IAM Analyst at the Metropolotian Transportation Authority (MTA).</b> 

<b>In my role, I’ve supported key IAM functions including privileged access cleanup, workflow mapping, MFA enforcement, and identity lifecycle documentation. I automated local admin account cleanup for 14,000+ assets, created end-to-end IAM workflow diagrams, updated core process documentation, assisted 150+ users with Duo MFA activation, and analyzed ServiceNow change requests to reduce stale accounts and strengthen identity hygiene.</b>

<b>I’ve built a Windows Server Active Directory lab where I practiced account provisioning, group management, and RBAC, and later recreated the same environment in Azure Entra ID to understand cloud-based identity management. I also completed a COVID-19 web scraping and data visualization project in Python, strengthening my data analysis and automation skills.</b>

<b>Outside of work, I enjoy learning new skills, exploring tech projects, and improving a little each day.
Thank you for reading my bio — feel free to check out my projects below.
